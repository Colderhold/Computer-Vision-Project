**Video Background Replacement using Green Screen - Computer Vision Project**

**Description**

This project is a computer vision application that allows for background replacement in a given video using a green screen technique. It takes a video file as input, detects the green screen area, and replaces it with a desired background image or video. The project demonstrates the power of computer vision algorithms in real-time video processing and can be used for various applications such as video editing, virtual backgrounds, and special effects.

**Features**

**Video Input and Output:**

The application takes a video file as input for background replacement.

It processes each frame of the video and generates an output video with the replaced background.

**Green Screen Detection:**

The application identifies the green screen region in each frame of the input video.

It utilizes color-based segmentation techniques to differentiate the green screen from the foreground.

**Background Replacement:**

Once the green screen region is detected, the application replaces it with a desired background image or video.

Users can specify a static image or even a separate video as the replacement background.

**Real-time Video Processing:**

The project aims to process the video frames in real-time to provide a smooth and seamless background replacement experience.

Efficient algorithms and optimizations are employed to achieve real-time performance.

**Technologies Used**

Python: The project is implemented using the Python programming language.

OpenCV: OpenCV is used for computer vision operations such as image processing, video reading, and manipulation.

Green Screen Detection Algorithms: Various color-based segmentation techniques are employed to detect the green screen area.

**Usage**

Launch the video background replacement application by running the project code.

Specify the input video file and the replacement background image or video.

The application will process each frame of the video, detect the green screen area, and replace it with the specified background.

Once the processing is complete, an output video file will be generated with the replaced background.
